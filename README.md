# Articles
I am an independent author and researcher with a passion for understanding the universe and sharing it with my community. As I also volunteer in a few organizations, some of my articles cover social issues that impact communities as well. I am working hard to publish papers and articles on various topics and try my best to explain them in simpler ways. Thank you for reading all the articles.
